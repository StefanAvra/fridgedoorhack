# fridgedoorhack
This is supposed to fix the issue with the door of the fridge in our flat.

### Issue
If you don't pay attention to close the fridge door properly, like when you push the door slightly in the hope that it's going to close like a proper fridge would, it stays a cm or so open. This is partly due to the cracked door shelf and partly due to the lack of attention. It's a cheap fridge but otherwise it's doing its job once it's closed properly. I could buy a replacement shelf but that would be less fun (and more expensive).

### Solution
tl;dr: Check if door is longer open than it should be. If so, attract attention.

Hardware:
* ESP8266 NodeMCU
* piezo buzzer
* metallic tape for the 'door switch'
* phone charger for powering the ESP8266 via USB
